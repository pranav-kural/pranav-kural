### Namaste 🙏

Glad you're visiting my profile 😇

### About me 👨🏼‍🎓

I'm an ambitious technology enthusiast currently primarily studying Computer Science at University of Ottawa. I have prior work experience as Web Developer and IT Operations Analyst at Bank of Montreal.

Presently, I'm more inclined towards machine learning (especially NLP and CV) and its applications in fields like cybersecurity, public policy implementation and medical sciences.

### 👨🏽‍💻 Currently spending time on: 
- Building automated vector embeddings using LLMs (following [Vector Embeddings](https://partee.io/2022/08/11/vector-embeddings/))
- Surveying present techniques of Intrusion Detection using AI/ML (reading [Intrusion Detection Using Ensemble Models](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-23633-4_11))
- Interested in exploring use of Deep learning for new drug discovery (read [Deep learning helps predict new drug combinations to fight Covid-19](https://news.mit.edu/2021/deep-learning-helps-predict-new-drug-combinations-fight-covid-19-0924))

From building prototype of a social networking and event management web platform for a Montreal based non-profit during a hackathon, to working on developing real-world web-based solutions for locally supported clients while serving at research department in Georgian College, one thing which has always taken a priority for me is to combine hands-on work experience with deep technical soundness to create pragmatic, scalable and efficient systems that serves in the best interest of the client and community.
