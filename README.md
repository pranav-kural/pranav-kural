### About me üë®üèº‚Äçüéì

I'm an ambitious technology enthusiast and a full-stack software developer. I love solving complex problems programmatically, and designing and building pragmatic, efficient, and scalable systems. I'm more of a generalist and a philomath with expertise and skills across a wide variety of domains; basically, I'll learn anything that it takes to solve a problem. 

**My Forte**

- **Front-end** (React, Next.js, Redux, Vue, Material Design, Tailwind CSS).
- **Databases** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Cloud Firestore, Redis).
- **Back-end** (System Design, Node.js, Spring Boot, REST, GraphQL, gRPC).
- **Distributed Development** (Kubernetes, Micro-services, EDA, Apache Kafka, Google Pub/Sub).
- **Generative AI** (RAG, LangChain, Vertex AI, Azure AI, OpenAI API, Pinecone).
- **Machine Learning** (SML, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, NLP, NLU, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn).
- **Cloud & DevOps** (AWS, Google Cloud, GitHub Actions, Terraform, ArgoCD, CI/CD).
- **Programming Languages** (TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Java, C++).
- **Other** (Networking, Cybersecurity, Android, iOS, Figma, UI/UX, zOS, ITIL, IT Ops).

### üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª Highlighted Projects:
- [Transac AI](https://transacai.pkural.ca/): Real-time AI-powered insights from transactional data using **Generative AI** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** over a distributed **Kubernetes**-based multi-cloud micro-services and event driven architecture (EDA). Using services like the **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**, **AWS EventBridge Scheduler**, **AWS Lambda**, **Confluent Kafka**, **Supabase**, **gRPC**, **GraphQL**, etc.
- [Plamatio](https://www.pkural.ca/blog/posts/plamatio-intro/): Building a highly performant, scalable, and resilient distributed [Plamatio Backend](https://github.com/pranav-kural/plamatio-backend) with **Go lang** and **PostgreSQL**, along with a **Next.js**-based **Redux**-powered [Plamatio frontend](https://github.com/pranav-kural/plamatio-frontend) using **Apache Kafka**-based data streaming pipelines & intergations with Clerk, Stripe and more.
- [Sustentia](https://www.pkural.ca/projects/#sustentia): **Sustainability**-oriented and AI-powered app to help both households and commercial users manage their inventory more smartly: optimizing resource utilization, reducing wastage from expiration, and tracking consumption. Uses real-time **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipelines with advance **prompt engineering** and **contextualization** techniques.
- [QvikChat](https://qvikchat.pkural.ca): Building a powerful open source framework to build and deploy secure, performant, and reliable production-ready Node.js-based REST APIs for conversational AI with advanced features and safety guardrails built-in. Also, built an open source LLM-based intent recognition framework [Intento](https://intento.pkural.ca/) using QvikChat.
- [pkural.ca Blog](https://www.pkural.ca/blog/blog.html): Writing easy-to-understand articles explaining concepts and latest developments in the software world.

From building a prototype of a social networking and event management web platform for a Montreal-based non-profit during a hackathon to working on developing powerful open-source conversational AI frameworks to empower developers around the world, one thing that has always taken a priority for me is to combine hands-on work experience with deep technical soundness to create pragmatic, scalable and efficient systems that serve in the best interest of the organization and the community.
