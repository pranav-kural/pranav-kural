### Namaste 🙏

Glad you're visiting my profile 😇

Currently I'm a student at University of Ottawa, studying Computer Science, and have prior work experience as Web Developer and IT Operations Analyst at BMO.

Presently, I'm more inclined towards machine learning (especially NLP and CV) and its applications in fields like cybersecurity and medical sciences.

I'm a self-motivated learner who loves challenges and problem solving. Please feel free to reach out to me. 😊
