Glad you're visiting my profile 😇

### About me 👨🏼‍🎓

I'm an ambitious technology enthusiast and a full-stack software developer with expertise in AI. Presently, I'm more inclined towards Machine Learning (especially NLP and CV), Generative AI (LLMs, RAG), and Software Development (back-end [REST, CI/CD], front-end [React, Redux]). 

### 👨🏽‍💻 Currently spending time on: 
- [QvikChat](https://qvikchat.pkural.ca): Building a powerful open source framework to build and deploy secure, performant, and reliable production-ready **chat services** with advanced features and safety guardrails, quickly & efficiently.
- [Intento](https://intento.pkural.ca): Developing an simple-to-use open source framework to build and deploy intent recognition services powered by **Large Language Models (LLM)**.
- [pkural.ca Blog](https://www.pkural.ca/blog/blog.html): Writing easy-to-understand articles explaining concepts and latest developments in Conversational AI, Generative AI, ML, RAG, and more.

From building a prototype of a social networking and event management web platform for a Montreal-based non-profit during a hackathon to working on developing powerful open-source conversational AI frameworks to empower developers around the world, one thing that has always taken a priority for me is to combine hands-on work experience with deep technical soundness to create pragmatic, scalable and efficient systems that serve in the best interest of the client and the community.
