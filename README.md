Glad you're visiting my profile 😇

### About me 👨🏼‍🎓

I'm an ambitious technology enthusiast currently studying Computer Science at the University of Ottawa. Presently, I'm more inclined towards Machine Learning (especially NLP and CV), Generative AI (LLMs, RAG), and Software Development (back-end [REST, GraphQL APIs], front-end [React, Redux]). 

### 👨🏽‍💻 Currently spending time on: 
- Building RAG-based conversational AI chat agents using LangChain, AWS Bedrock (Titan), and Meta AI's Llama 2 Chat model.
- Surveying present techniques of Intrusion Detection using AI/ML (reading [Intrusion Detection Using Ensemble Models](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-23633-4_11))
- Writing easy-to-understand articles explaining concepts and latest developments in AI, ML, NLP, cybersecurity and more on my blog: [pkural.ca](https://www.pkural.ca/) 

From building a prototype of a social networking and event management web platform for a Montreal-based non-profit during a hackathon to working on developing real-world web-based solutions for locally supported clients while serving at the research department in Georgian College, one thing which has always taken a priority for me is to combine hands-on work experience with deep technical soundness to create pragmatic, scalable and efficient systems that serve in the best interest of the client and the community.
